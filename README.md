# Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts

> **Stage 9 of 12 — Career Progression Project**  
> Portfolio project by **Yugandhar Ethamukkala**.

Local Kubernetes progressive delivery lab for canary releases, promotion, pause, and rollback using Argo Rollouts.

## Career Progression Story

Release strategy step: after GitOps, I focused on safer releases using canary deployment and rollback workflows.

This repo is part of my 12-project DevOps portfolio path. The goal is to show steady growth from CI/CD foundations into AWS cloud, Kubernetes, GitOps, observability, DevSecOps, progressive delivery, and AI-enabled deployments.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Advanced Kubernetes topic that stands out on GitHub.
- Low-cost and easy to demonstrate with screenshots.
- Useful for explaining safer releases, canary strategy, and rollback.

## Tech Stack

`Kubernetes` `Argo Rollouts` `Canary Deployment` `Progressive Delivery` `Kind` `Minikube`

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker where containers are used
- Cloud CLI/tools only when deploying cloud resources
- `kubectl`, `kind`, `terraform`, `sam`, `maven`, `npm`, or `python` depending on the project
- Never commit real `.env` files, API keys, access keys, kubeconfigs, private keys, or tokens

## Local Run

```bash
make validate
make up
make logs
```

## Validation Before GitHub Upload

Run these checks before pushing major changes:

```bash
make validate
```

## Deployment Overview

1. Create the local Kubernetes cluster.
2. Install Argo Rollouts controller.
3. Apply rollout manifests.
4. Promote or abort the rollout while capturing status screenshots.

## Screenshots to Add

This project did not include ready project snapshots in the uploaded folder, so I prepared a screenshot folder for you.

Add these after you run the project:

- `docs/screenshots/architecture.png`
- `docs/screenshots/pipeline-success.png`
- `docs/screenshots/deployment-output.png`
- `docs/screenshots/monitoring-dashboard.png`
- `docs/screenshots/cleanup-proof.png`

Do not add screenshots with account IDs, IP addresses, tokens, billing pages, or private URLs.

## Cleanup / Cost Control

Run cleanup commands after testing so cloud resources do not keep charging:

```bash
make down
```

## Security Notes

- Use GitHub Actions OIDC, Jenkins credentials, AWS Secrets Manager, Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets instead of hard-coded keys.
- Keep `.env` files local and commit only `.env.example` with safe placeholders.
- Review Terraform plans before apply/destroy.
- Do not publish account IDs, private IPs, public IPs from your lab, billing pages, or credential screenshots.

## How I Would Explain This in an Interview

I built this project as part of my DevOps portfolio to show hands-on experience with the tools used in real delivery environments. The focus is not only on writing code, but also on creating a repeatable workflow for build, validation, deployment, security, monitoring, and cleanup.

In a real project, I would connect this type of setup with environment-specific variables, approval gates, secrets management, monitoring dashboards, and rollback steps so teams can release safely and troubleshoot faster.
